								<h2>GREAT question, thanks for asking.</h2>
								<p>Native plants are already adapted to their local climate and the soil conditions where they naturally occur. That means that they've been here for way longer than you've been out there with a watering can and a dream - <br> they've practically been taking care of themselves for centuries.</p>
                <p>In addition to requiring less water and less maintenance, they're a huge part of the existing ecosystem. <br>
                They have natural protection from those pesky pests, as well as providing shelter and food for wildlife and supporting important pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
